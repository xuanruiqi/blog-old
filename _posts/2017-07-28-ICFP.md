I have received a scholarship from [PLMW@ICFP '17](http://http://icfp17.sigplan.org/track/PLMW-ICFP-2017), so I 
will be attending the conference in Oxford, UK. I will be going to PLMW, the main ICFP conference, the 
Erlang Workshop, and probably the Haskell Symposium.

This will be my first conference, but I'll try to write up about all talks I go to.
