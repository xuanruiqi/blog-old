Hi, world! This is Xuanrui. I've tried a few places for my blog like
WordPress. They are all awesome, but, to keep things simple, I've finally settled
on GitHub and use Jekyll. I adapted the Jekyll Now starter template, but I've also
modified it a bunch.

Why am I blogging? Honestly, I don't know. The rationale is probably no more than
a simple desire to share my thoughts with the rest of the world. So let's see
how it goes.
